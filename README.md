# wav-files-from-basaa-french-dict
Generate empty .wav files that will match entries in a .xlsx file, containing Basaa-French translations and examples.
This is to avoid having to manually enter each file name when using [Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/).

I've worked on this project as a Research Assistant under [Dr Fatima Hamlaoui](https://www.french.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/fatima-hamlaoui) at the University of Toronto from June to August 2018.
